# Benchmark of Software Engineering for Deep Learning

## TL;DR

This repo collects artifacts of recent papers on the topic *Software Engineering for Deep Learning* including but not limited to the testing, debugging and verification of DNNs.

Collected artifacts include code, data (pre-trained models, datasets and training scripts etc) and documents (papers and others if any).

We aim at provding Docker image for every colelcted project and host data on Rutgers Archive server.
